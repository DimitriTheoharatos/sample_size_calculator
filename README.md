# Sample Size Calculator

## Description
This sample size calculator can be used when running an experiment comparing proportions of two groups (e.g. conversion rates).
Unlike most online calculators, it takes into account both multiple testing and unequal allocation of assignments.  This means
you can use it for tests with multiple variants and uneven splits (e.g. 80/10/10 split among three variants). 

## Prerequisites
In order to run the application, all you need to have installed is python and a web browser.
